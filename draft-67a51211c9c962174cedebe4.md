Despite the common sense of using retention features in Microsoft 365 I never had trouble removing data if I had to. But 2025 teached me something new - but lets start from the beginning.

As we all know, something things

In general my approach of deleting data which is on hold is more or less the same:

1. If there are Retention Policies in place, exclude the site or group from the retention policy.
    
2. Close existing eDiscovery cases with a hold
    
3. Disable Data loss prevention (DLP) policies, if there are some
    

In my specific case I double-checked all parts of the game, but only had to face the rentention policy exclusion. Five minutes later I browsed the Preservation Hold Library. Important to mention that this library keeps copies of all modified or deleted files as enforced by the Retention policy or eDiscovery holds. You can reach it by using “PreservationHoldLibrary“ as a suffix on your SharePoint site URL: [https://TenantDomain.sharepoint.com/sites/SiteName/PreservationHoldLibrary](https://YourDomain.sharepoint.com/sites/YourSite/PreservationHoldLibrary)

I tried to delete some files…and tried and tried. Every experienced M365 admin knows that 5 minutes is not the appropriate period of time to get things changed. So I kept trying after 24 hours… But the error still told me very kind:

“Sorry, something went wrong. The server has encountered the following error(s): &lt;File Name&gt; This library contains items that have been modified or deleted but must remain available due to eDiscovery holds. Items cannot be modified or removed.
