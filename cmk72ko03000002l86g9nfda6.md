You want to know what I did between Christmas and New Years Eve? Of course I spent time with the family, but that would be no content for a tech blog right?  
I tried out the [**Microsoft MCP Server for Enterprise (preview)**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/mcp-server/overview)

## What is this for?

In general the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is a standard that lets AI models securely and consistently access external tools, data, and services.

In our case the MCP is adressing GraphAPI. Its abilities is defined by its [MCP Server scopes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/mcp-server/get-started?tabs=portal%2Cvscode#list-of-mcp-server-scopes). Of course you know some of them, like User.Read.All or Organization.Read.All.  
First key takeaway: the MCP has only read scopes.

The process how the MCP works looks like this:

You will recognize the single steps at the end of the post in my short ref case.

## What do you have to do?

Honestly - just follow the [Microsoft article](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/mcp-server/get-started?tabs=http%2Cvscode) because its on point. Let me outline the basic steps for you:

1. Install **Microsoft.Entra.Beta** PowerShell module (version 1.0.13 or later):
    
    ```powershell
    Install-Module Microsoft.Entra.Beta -Force -AllowClobber
    ```
    
2. To register the MCP Server, you have to connect to Entra and consent to the required permissions:
    
    ```powershell
    Connect-Entra -Scopes 'Application.ReadWrite.All', 'Directory.Read.All', 'DelegatedPermissionGrant.ReadWrite.All'
    ```
    
3. Register the Microsoft MCP Server for Enterprise in your tenant and grant all permissions to Visual Studio Code:
    
    ```powershell
    Grant-EntraBetaMCPServerPermission -ApplicationName VisualStudioCode
    ```
    
4. After the grant you will find some new Enterprise Applications:
    
    | Name | Globally unique **appId** (client ID) |
    | --- | --- |
    | Microsoft MCP Server for Enterprise | `e8c77dc2-69b3-43f4-bc51-3213c9d915b4` |
    | Visual Studio Code | `aebc6443-996d-45c2-90f0-388ff96faa56` |
    
    The “server“ app ships a service principal with the endpoint `https://mcp.svc.cloud.microsoft/enterprise`

    The “client“ app named “Visual Studio Code“ has the defined MCP scopes:

5. Connect to MCP using VS Code
    
    Go for it and click [Install Microsoft MCP Server for Enterprise](https://vscode.dev/redirect/mcp/install?name=Microsoft%20MCP%20Server%20for%20Enterprise&config=%7b%22name%22:%22Microsoft%20MCP%20Server%20for%20Enterprise%22%2c%22type%22:%22http%22%2c%22url%22:%22https://mcp.svc.cloud.microsoft/enterprise%22%7d) to open VS Code's MCP install page:

After a successfull authentication you and your MCP are set.

## Prompting

I have started prompting in VS Code by an easy idea: I asked to evaluate the oldest user logins.  
It’s fun to see how natural language is translated to proper Graph calls and vice versa:

To understand the documented process above about how the MCP Server works, I created a short recording. Every M365 admin should relate these daily basic tasks:

A next step I like to try is to use a custom MCP client and not VS Code. In case this happens, I will let you know for sure. 😁
