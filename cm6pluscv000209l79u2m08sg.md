Most people are thinking of Frankenstein, but my mind citates [Redman with Smash Sumthin'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdYEZncgz1M). An awesome 2000 song and a great intro for a first post of an tech related blog, right? I mean it is like 1 or 0 in informatics: Alive or smashed.

Hoping this blog will be alive - even if it looks like Frankenstein itself…

## What\`s the idea here?

Even if I like the idea and the simplicity of the mentioned binary system, there is more than black and white in all our everyday. I stick to that concept except for this blog design and coffee. Coffee should always and only be black - and honestly Starbucks offers no coffee.

But well - in case I consult customers about Microsoft 365 or Azure services I try to grey-scale at least. Because most cases allow different ways of technical solutions. In my opinion the task of the consultant is to break down some technical options with its advantages and drawbacks for the customer. Best case scenario would be to implement the best suitable concept.  
Now answering the header question: **Creativity**

I want to share some exciting technical approaches or features out of the Microsoft universe. And of course there will be challenges, troubleshooting, drawbacks, issues and many more such things here, because everybody is aware of Microsoft\`s well established blue screen of death, right?

## Creativity, hm?!

Yepp - because this is what all IT architects, consultants, engineers unites: finding inventive solutions.  
As well as job titles, too.

But yes, the Microsoft universe is a big one and I am far to humble to think I know a lot of it - so what can you expect here? Some key skills of good consultants are demarcation and honesty, so I define some topics, which you will find here:

* Microsoft 365
    
* Microsoft Entra
    
* Microsoft Security
    
* Scripting
    
* Automation
    
* Microsoft Microsoft
    

and of course things I forgot and sarcasm as well.
